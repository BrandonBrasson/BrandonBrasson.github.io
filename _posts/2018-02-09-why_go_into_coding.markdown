I decided to develop my experience in computer engineering. Not because it's what everyone thinks is the trending thing to do, but it's what I need to do, for me. Technology, is how consumers around the world will buy goods and blockchain will have a huge impact on this. Company's will need skilled employees and I want to be on the for front of this. Not to mention the salary of a Web Developer is exceptional.
