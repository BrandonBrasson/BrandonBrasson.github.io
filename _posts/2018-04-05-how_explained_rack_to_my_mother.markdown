I first explained what rack is rack is a modular and adaptable interface for developing web apps in Ruby. rack  requests and responses to make it coding a lot easier. I also explained that rack can be software and web framework
as you can tell it was hard to full explain it to her but. She had somewhat of understand of what i was talking a but at the end  she laughs and said im not in to that coding stuff.
