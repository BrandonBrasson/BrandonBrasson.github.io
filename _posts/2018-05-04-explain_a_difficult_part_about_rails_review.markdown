 If I was a teaching  people how to code I would say how many people feel about coding. I would tell  them that coding is hard it not for everyone but  the hard part is not really codeing it youself . Having the drive to learn ruby on rails is the same.  write the  best code you can reseach to find new way to code . Also to code ask help .your not alone even if you feel like it.
